cargo
=====

Cargo is a collection of general-purpose support modules for Python. It aims to
be loosely-coupled, so that subsets of the library can be used individually. It
is primarily intended to support the borg algorithm portfolio project:

Pieces of its functionality, however, could be useful in other contexts.
